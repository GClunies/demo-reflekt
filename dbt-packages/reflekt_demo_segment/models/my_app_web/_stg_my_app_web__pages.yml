      - name: page_id
        description: The unique identifier of the page call.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: source_schema
        description: The schema of the source table.

        description: The source table.
      - name: tracking_plan
        description: The name of the tracking plan where the event is defined.
      - name: page_name
        description: The page name (used to group similar pages, e.g., `Spot
          Report`).
      - name: call_type
        description: The type of call that generated the data.

      - name: sent_at_tstamp
        description: Time on client device when call was sent, OR sent_at
          value manually passed in. NOTE - sent_at is NOT USEFUL for analysis
          since it’s not always trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted
          and affected by clock skew.
      - name: received_at_tstamp
        description: Time on Segment server clock when call was received.
          received_at is used as sort key in Warehouses. For max query speed,
          received_at is the recommended timestamp for analysis when chronology
          DOES NOT matter as chronology is NOT ENSURED.
      - name: tstamp
        description: When the call was invoked. Calculated by Segment to
          correct client-device clock skew. Use for analysis when chronology
          DOES matter.

          where the call was invoked.
      - name: referrer_host
        description: The hostname of the page that referred the user to
          the page where the call was invoked.
      - name: ip

      - name: user_agent
        description: The user agent string of the device generating the
          event.
      - name: path

          from the DOM API.
      - name: search

          to location.search from the DOM API.
      - name: title
        description: Page’s title. Equivalent to document.title from the
          DOM API.
      - name: url
        description: Page’s full URL. Segment first looks for the canonical
